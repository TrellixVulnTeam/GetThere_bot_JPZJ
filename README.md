<h1> GetThere_bot </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
My first side project in 2018 for creating a telegram chatbot! <br/>

Rationale of this side project is to familiarize myself with software engineering outside of my existing data science knowledge and the use of GitHub. <br/>
This chat aims to obtain a route from point A to point B stated by the user <i> (still a work in progress as on 21 july 2018 ) </i> <br/>
Possible features to be added in the future:  <br/>
a. Stores users in database and history for potential customizations <br/>
b. User to send in their location <br/>

<h3><b> Requirements: </b></h3> 
Python 3.6 <br/>
<h3><b> Libraries used: </b></h3>
requests <br/>
json <br/>
time <br/>
